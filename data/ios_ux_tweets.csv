For a better user experience on Mastodon, try Metatext (iOS), Tusky (Android), or just a browser! I never used the 'official' apps, but I've heard that they are much worse - and unfortunately, that most new users are going that route.
With latest #ios update, in phone app there is no curser. So I can‚Äôt add country codes in the front after copying a phone number. Frustrating user experience. #apple #iphone #iOS16
"If you're joining  #Mastodon it will likely be a better experience if you use an app. 

If you're an Apple user, I am hearing good things about Metatext for iOS.

I'm on Android so I'm using Tusky. It's pretty clean.  

Any other Mastodon app recommendations are welcome!"
So after working with Hive Social for an afternoon I learned a few things. 1. It has primarily been developed for iOS, Android users are going to get a substantially downgraded experience. It's just out of beta. And there seems to be nothing for PC at this time.
Out of the suite of @Microsoft365 @Office apps on iOS &amp; iPadOS, @MSOneNote seems to be the one lagging behind the flock in user experience and performance. Worth some attention from the product team, it‚Äôs got tons of potential.

We watch streaming services from HBO, Showtime, Prime, Netflix, Apple, Hulu, etc., etc.  Have to say that Amazon Prime really has the user experience nailed - so much better than the others on iOS.  The worst?  Either Apple (surprisingly) or HBO (also surprisingly).
There's no comparing Android to iOS because one is a versatile, open-source operating system that offers users a customizable experience, while the other is a closed-source operating system that offers a more uniform experience.

After being back on iPhone for 2 months now, I‚Äôve actually deduced that Android is better than iOS, user experience is much less of a nuisance and actually more intuitive while giving you options. Apple feels backwards sometimes.
"I do not like how Apple prioritized getting their devices to *look* like they‚Äôre immediately ready on start-up but still need several seconds to become actually usable.

Whether it‚Äôs iOS or macOS, the interface is presented before it‚Äôs ready. That‚Äôs a bad user experience."
The experience for most ios users is quite similar but Samsung Android is way different from infinix Android.

There's no escaping the fact that Android is far more popular than iOS, but that doesn't make Apple's operating system any less capable. In fact, iOS often outperforms Android in key areas, such as security, updates, and the overall user experience.
iPhone 13 Pro Max users on iOS 16, share your experience about the battery life and share me the battery graph on Settings.
New ios updates are cute and all, but how about this: touch an hold an app icon, then show amongst the options ‚Äúmove to group:‚Äù and show a list of the groups of apps you already have. Dragging the app around pages is the worst user experience.

Updated to iOS 16. since i was running low on storage, updater gave me an option of deleting some apps and reinstalling them, just like Android. Only difference? The updated did it on its own, unlike Android, where you have to do it manually. This is user experience at its best..
Curious what percentage of Windows/Android users text from their PC laptop/desktop and what their experience is. Love this feature on MacOS/iOS.
"Just learned that on an iOS+Android group text Android will translate *iOS-user tapbacks* into emojis while $AAPL shows other iOS users ""John Doe Liked '{{message}}'"".

The best products come from user empathy; I imagine it's hard for Apple to create great developer tools when employees can't create and distribute their own apps."
One thing most blind iOS users don't realize is that these days, Android offers a superior accessibility experience to iOS. It's the little things like how the messages app in iOS throws you back to the top every time you delete a message while the Android one doesn't.

I'm glad that Apple doesn't support sideloading on iOS because if they did, mobile developers would stampede towards Electron and almost all iOS apps would bundle Chromium, take up hundreds of megs of ram and kill battery life on the iPhone along with the user experience.
