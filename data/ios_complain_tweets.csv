Yesterday VR YouTubers announced the upcoming headset from @BigscreenVR the comments I keep seeing regarding the use of iPhone is just infuriating. People could easily to just borrow a friend’s iPhone or just get a used one then sell it.
Instead they complain about it"
My teacher has still the @u2 songs of innocence for free but he don’t complain at all. And even he is not a really big U2 fan. I like this kind of people. I ask him why you don’t delete it. He said I cannot delete it. When you bought a new IPhone the album is there. 😂
"Imagine if the requirements to complain about Rihanna's performance were to have a matching bank account and talent, the internet would be a quiet place today.

Instead, all you need is a cracked iPhone."
okay but frfr, the only android defenders are the ones with androids… iphone users don’t complain… some droid users do… apples j better
"Beware if you have Apple IPhone 14 .. Lock Screen very often shrinks &amp; wants us to Customize Wallpaper… I’m hearing it’s a tracking thing … call &amp; complain so they delete the software .

"I didn’t realize I hit a nerve on those that got scammed in believing that their iPhone 13 is a different phone as the 6 but ❤️paying 2x the price. Keep believing in the new chip they put in every year

BTW, I can afford it, I also don’t complain about the price. Read the post 😉"

"People complain about eggs being $7 but not a single complaint about an iPhone being $1200

Those same people spend hours on twitter on the $1200 cell phone complaining how they have no money bc of crypto scams

They scam themselves by not getting the free phone

Karma banget dulu suka complain sama iPhone user yg di silent.... sekarang gw pun begitu wkwkwkwkw
People complain about iPhone chargers not lasting long but I noticed that usb-c chargers don't last long either. So nothing to complain about
The same people slating people for playing Hogwarts Legacy will wear Coco Chanel perfume (nazi) watch Miramax movies (sex offender Weinstein) and complain on Twitter with their iPhone (child labour and human rights issues). Get your heads out of your asses. Idiots. #HogwartLegacy
I'm back on Twitter to complain about how shocked I am that iPhone has not figured out FaceTime Voicemails. I refuse to update my phone again until this is sorted.
"Give 20 people an iPhone, a MacBook, and an internet connection.

Some have:

Build or complain.

Your choice.

An article talking about how terrible working on Iphone factory is, including being insulted daily and fainting in the middle of working, and the comments are full of people saying just quit or don't complain if you get paid well. Fuck this fucking shit
kind of a tough one that you can’t help noticing pervasive iPhone addiction is crippling public life and general human vitality but if you complain about it you sound like a banksy / Alec monopoly guy
i hate google pixel ads so much. i will never buy your damn product. you could show me a live video of my immediate family being bound and tortured and say i had to buy a google pixel to save them and i would open twitter on my iphone to complain about it
People complain about people “virtue” signaling over the new HP game, and the first thing they do is VS how they’re good people for supporting the devs, and how the boycotters are bad because iphone. My man, do what you want, but screw off with the moral superiority bs.
"its so funny to me when boomers complain about young people not being able to afford a home and one of their solutions is always centered on ""not buying the latest iPhone/laptop/electronic"" as if any of those things aren't a necessity for employment &amp; job hunting in todays world"
How the fuck are teenagers affording iphones if its not mommy and daddy buying it for them? Bc i hear one more entitled child complain about the lack of heaphobe jacks on a new iphone.... Yall got phobes more exspensive then all of my assrts combined kid.
All those tenders just look like the new fishrot, getting funds for 2024 campaign. And they bought every MP an iPhone, so they don't complain. Poverty is proudly sponsored by the Government.
&amp; idgaf next episode getting recorded on an iPhone 6 &amp; Kittie nor Taylor bet not complain about shit cause u hoes ain’t gotta do nun but sit in a fucking camera.
every time some old person comes into my work to complain about technology for no reason I get so annoyed like 😑 I bet they depend on their grandkids to help them with their ancient iphone even tho it's essentially like the fisher-price of smartphones
Our own people are something else! You complain about my prices but will pay hundreds for an iPhone &amp; Jordans. They don’t give a blank about you but I truly care about you being successful! #prioritiesinorder
Although I'm sure it's hard to complain about the #CostOfLivingCrisis when you just bought the latest iPhone on a 3 year lease. #crazy
I swear to god i’m losing it. when did it become a common opinion that “poor people should work until they die and cannot complain about their conditions bc I see u with an iphone, “can’t be that poor if u can afford to entertain yourself” Are we living on the same planet here?
After using my work iPhone for a while now I laugh at iPhone users who complain about green texts 😂
Which iPhone has the best camera quality? I’m hearing people complain about the iPhone 14’s camera quality. 😬
When I see people complain about having to pay 20USD for a years worth of base Nintendo Online while they have a iPhone 14 Pro Max at 66USD per month....
every time I think about upgrading my phone (iPhone 8+) I think about all the apps I’ll have to finally update and I get sad. like yeah I’ll get twitter circles but I’ll also get all the other shitty updates that I see ppl complain about…
You use an iphone and you complain about not having a job. I will never take you serious.
i love seeing iphone users complain about the same product they keep choosing to buy
We complain about Apple making a new (same) iPhone each year... we want to talk about frontend frameworks popping out every month?
People complain about their iPhone losing battery but mf you are getting tech you couldn’t get for 100k fifty years  ago
I don’t have any iPhone or Mac Repair time all weekend except for before we open Sunday. I should complain like everyone else does.
Twitter on iPhone sucks because now I have that FYP tab but I. Got voice notes back so I can’t complain.

Android users, stop buy iPhone and then complain about it
"I’m here to complain about the new iPhone shape. I respect the nod to iPhones past, but the slim and rounded shape is preferred. This thing is boxy and inconvenient for people like me who wear their phones all day at work. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
nothing is weirder than that whole “ my iPhone isn’t overheating bc I got it from iStore &amp; you got yours from Sis Ntosh” chat when people complain about their phones overheating 😭😭
Sometimes you want to complain about how long it takes to restore an iPhone and then you remember you have ~150,000 photos and it’s taking so long b/c it’s downloading a preview of every single one 😶‍🌫️
I don't know why do people even complain about iPhones not having AOD (except for 14 Pro series). Not having an AOD is actually a feature because Apple doesn't want iPhone users to get distracted every time they look at their phone while doing some work, as the screen is on.
GUEST CAME UP FROM  BEHIND ME. WHILE IM LIGERALLY SITTING ON A COUCH GIGGLIGN AT MY IPHONE. TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR ROOM OOHHHHH YOURE OVER. IMMEDIATELY OVER.
can you let us complain im peace!!! have you seen those iphone quality teasers!!!!!!
Seeing iphone users complain about the new TL feels like being on the other side of a portal and seeing those who went through first being slaughtered.
coming on twitter to complain about how much i hate the latest iphone update but then i got distracted by how much i hate the latest twitter update and god it's all just going to keep getting progressively worse until i finally have to go outside isn't it
I may always complain about having to pay 50$ for my fast iPhone charger but I'll never regret it because my phone was just on 8% and it's already on 51 and i put it on charge about 15 minutes ago lol
I see low-pay employees using the iPhone 14 Pro Max or the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4 and they complain that they ain’t making enough money for rent or food. And don’t forget their Nikes, Apple Watches, &amp;etc. #BallOfConfusion

"When people complain about the ""new"" Twitter layout I always laugh and think to myself ""man it must really suck to have an iPhone."""
Can a complain please make a good lightening to HDMI adapter for iPhone, these Apple ones are ANNOYING 🤦🏽‍♂️
"iPhone Overheats

A lot of customers complain that their devices turning extremely hot. They also affirm that feel like their phones are swelling and they open by themselves. This problem was already explained, but iPhones tend to present this issue more than other phones."
The main advantage of Android app development always taking a back seat to Apple app development is watching all you iPhone users complain about Twitter crop this and that and I'm just here with no crop update still.
Black kids will come to univarsity looking for space, wearing N$1000 Nike sneakers, N$700 Guess Jeans, N$945 Arsenal t-shirt, N$250 redbat cap, N$24000 iPhone and a N$600 wrists watch but will complain about registration money.
I’m going to complain about iCloud storage but first, if you know of any management tools for photos or iPhone backups, LMK. Like, not Apple’s sad shit, which is where my problems are…

Isn't it amazing how liberal snowflake cancel cultureists can complain about oppression all while wearing Nikes made in Indonesian sweatshops, sipping on their $6 late' with beans picked by impoverished Columbian laborers on their $1100 iPhone made by slave labor in China?
"The upside of being on Android and using Twitter is that all the new ""experiments"" (like the For You tab) don't usually make it into my app build and are killed once enough iPhone users complain.

But we're at 2+ years and counting on not having Voice Tweets...can't win 'em all."

Naa jud weird iPhone users. Like they complain why they don't have certain features on their phone, only to find out they haven't updated their software since ever. Smh.
iPhone 13 gold pro stolen at Ahmedabad. PNR 2835141271, train 22916, coach A2 between 7:45 AM and 8:00AM. On duty TC did not help to file FIR. Vadodara police just took complain. Railway closed complain without solution. @IRCTCofficial @RailwaySeva @WesternRly @RailMinIndia
iPhone users complain about storage but they have not considered the fact that it's because they take too many photos in their perfect camera. if they had a shitty android camera they wouldn't be taking photos and complaining about having no storage
Jiomart par order kiya tha iPhone 12 128 GB 25 November ko Tera December ko return ho chuka hai lekin refund Nahin de raha hai बार-बार phone karne per bola ja raha hai jald se jald a jaega lekin abhi tak nahin mila complain bhi race kiya tha complaint pending mein hi rahata hai
I can't help but notice how many Americans complain about how expensive everything is or how they are not getting paid enough. Then the utter snobbery about how they must have an iPhone and turn their noses up at @Android.

Yu come Ghana dey form hard guy, come claim someone ein girlfriend….. now the street boiz also claim yur iPhone aa, yu dey come complain😂😂
It's so funny watching iPhone consumers complain about the device that they chose to spend $1,000+ and they don't know how anything works. They don't even know how to use iCloud properly. They pay for terabyte of storage, and don't even know what that is. 😂😭😂😭🤣😭🤣😭😂😭🤣😭

"Videos of kids crying because they're ""grateful"" they got an iPhone for Christmas is not cute.

Man as much as I been saying I'm ready to get another iphone I really can't complain about this android because I real life could've been without a phone
You know you have a good life when you complain about it from your iPhone.
Aku rasa aku kena angkat juga la iphone satu. Isu front end kat iphone ni kadang2 mengirap sebab tak boleh dpt same result kat emulator, dev lain pun memang pengemar android. Bila client complain dah mengelabah cari iphone.
Oh wait I do have something to complain about. So I updated my iPhone now it’s acting stupid. Don’t update your iPhone.
Why persons buy a iPhone with 64GB and complain about space being full
IPhone storage is a scam. I have 50 000 pictures and videos on my old android phone and never did it complain about space . IPhone has so many extras , I had to purchase a charger head because the phone came with only a cord ai bandla . Now I must pay for storage ?😒
Budak2 sekarang ni complain semua mahal, tapi tgk semua pakai latest iphone. Tak mahal pulak? Nak flex punya pasal!

We complain about the Marvel dominance of the cinema, but on his birthday I wonder what John Cassavetes would have created with access to an iPhone and a Gofundme account?
Let’s all use iPhones so that we don’t complain about iPhone users.

Being #gay is a choice, yes it is you’re not born gay you choose to be gay just like I choose to eat chicken everyday and own an iPhone and wear black socks, I can’t complain if I choose to a country that doesn’t let me have these like #NorthKorea it’s my own fault for going 😂
Then y’all complain it’s too bright. Really? It looks like it’s still on? You mean to tell me you can’t tell so much that you really think your iPhone is still on? You haven’t learned it yet? It didn’t take long to get use to it. Y’all are picky. I love it. But you have options.
The only time people don’t complain about capitalism is when a new iPhone or other spectacular comes out…
"People complain they are broke but you have the money for these:
- New IPhone
- Starbucks everyday
- Eat out for lunch
- A gym membership you probably never use
- 3+ monthly streaming services

Yeah, complain about capitalism on a fucking iphone.

Someone’s gotta have an iPhone angle of the subway kickflip, please just drop it tonight so I don’t have to complain about Strobeck for the rest of the year
As much as I complain about how Apple continues to monopolize on us, I love my iPhone.
After seeing all the reviewers complain about AOD on the iPhone - I’m surprised to say it’s one of my favourite features 😂 I’m guessing people already used to an AOD would be okay with it
"“Damn people complain about twitter on twitter is so funny haha! Also, apple, please don’t take down twitter!”-Elon musk,
Tweeted from iPhone."
. @FoxNews your hosts are are complaining about #Apple &amp; #China, BUT look at how many of then blatantly show their personal  iPhone on air. Such hypocrites. Actions, not words. Get rid of your iphones.. #hypocrites #FOX otherwise don't complain
"So let me get this right. If you're an app developer and you want your app in the iPhone store it is in their terms of service that you cannot complain about them on Social Media? This is the sign of a highly insecure company. And 30%?! Seriously!

Google Play looks really good!"
"I will now complain about Apple's 30% app store fee and censorship issues from my iPhone and then scroll twitter on my iMac, receiving notifications of responses to this tweet on my Apple Watch before responding on my iPad. 

So yeah, fuck Apple."
I’ve had the iPhone and apple products since I was in high school and if @Apple  takes Twitter off the App Store because they can’t stand actual free speech happening on social media… I’ll complain about it on my iPhone.
I love when people complain about Apple... on their iPhone 🤣🤣
"have the ENG v. WAL match up on my projector screen and USA v. IRN match on my laptop and am tweeting from my iPhone and I would definitely recommend against this

"Elon Musk: *makes fun of people that complain about twitter on twitter*

Also Elon Musk: *complains about apple on an iphone*"
"I love when people complain about #iPhone
On an iPhone"
Just think, the Chinese people are in the streets dying for the very  rights you piss on and complain about every day from the comfort of starbucks on your iphone.
There are people who complain about @elonmusk  complaining about Apple on an iPhone, but at the same time they complain about @Twitter on Twitter...
Like there's a 0% chance that we won't be able to use the twitter app on iPhone but Elon told us cuz they probably got some guidelines he doesn't like and to bypass em he just makes us all complain bout the shit potentially not being on there so now apple sees it and yields
It's so funny how @elonmusk is hating on everyone who rants about him, especially those who use Twitter to complain to him, and yet here he is now bitching about Apple, as he tweets on his iPhone.
"A few weeks ago Elon Musk tweeted why the left were using Twitter to complain about Twitter 

Well, today he has been using his iPhone to complain about Twitter with Apple 🤭"
"Musk is using an iPhone to complain about Apple on twitter. 

He was making jokes of people the other complaining about twitter on twitter.😀

Now I understand why he wants to get rid of the 'twitter for iPhone' thingy. 😀😀"
It's kind of funny watching people complain about Apple while tweeting from their #iPhone.
All of using Twitter to complain about Twitter is the equivalent of Elon Musk using an iPhone to complain about Apple. At the end of the day, we are all just the same human inhabitants of the earth
"If Apple stops supporting Twitter I will:

1. Jailbreak the current iPhone.
2. Not buy iPhone’s in the future.
3. Complain to my congressman about Apple monopoly."
"Two minutes silence for ppl who think @elonmusk shouldn't complain on iPhone because he owns one. 
Should customer complain?
#Apple #iPhone"
Folks trying to dunk on @elonmusk over his @Apple tweets coming from an iPhone are the same people who constantly complain about the neighbourhood they live in cause ‘it’s changed’😖 Instead of just moving🤷‍♂️
We complain about Twitter on Twitter. Elon complained about Apple - on Twitter - on an iPhone. The difference is: He can set up a meeting with Apple to understand why Apple would do this if he was serious. He knows. He doesn't care. He is just making noise. Distraction.
"You can't complain about Twitter if you use Twitter
You can't complain about Apple if you use an iPhone
You can't complain about gas prices if you drive a gas car
You can't complain about the president if you live in the country
You can't complain about your job if you work there"
Musk using an iPhone to complain about Apple just emphasizes the point of how much of a monopoly they seem to have.
I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT APPLE WHILE TWEETING WITH iPHONE
Hey Elon, we should edit Twits! My fingers are big. No matter how oversized my iPhone is when I type, my fingers go here and there. Make errors unintentionally. My iPhone doesn’t complain, but it bothers me.
You have to be stupid to complain about the battery on the iPhone 14 pros if you’re using always on display. Do people think it’s not gonna take the battery down or something? It’s still using the screen and showing notifications so of course it’s gonna die faster than the 13 pro
"Hello Apple
You won’t believe Siri complain of too many requests from me today and said ok you know what I’ll rather not say anything  #Apple #iPhone"
many complain about the iPhone alarm, but it is the only thing that manages to wake me up lol
iPhone users complain to android users that they have green bubbles... but iPhone users are the one with green bubbles??
"Lagos Is A Tough Place 😂 
This Lady Came To Complain About #200 Coke,Now She Lost Her iPhone 13 In The Process."
Hearing an iPhone user complain about reaction messages is liberating.

My mama finally got an iPhone and hearing her complain about everything is making me want to go back and get her that ugly Samsung she wanted
Your iPhone is lazy. Put it to work. I promise it won't complain.
“Waaaahhhh but @elonmusk is abusing his workers! I’m now going to complain about it from my iPhone or Android that was made in a sweat shop by workers who are actually abused! Look at how morally righteous I am!”- Every left wing looney toon on @Twitter
"The last 3 days: iphone destroyed, Vinyl Tavern site crashed, PC GPU took a vacation, iMac on life support (2013 - can't complain right?) AND we're only at 5% for our album goal that ends in a week.  

Guess what? It sucks but I'm alive and I'm loved."
"Anyone else hate the font on the clock on the lock screen on the iPhone update?

I know, silly thing to complain about, but I had to say it."
Y’all complaining about @elonmusk buying twitter but still using it. Same people that complain about capitalism while tweeting with their iPhone.
If you're reading this on a Chinese made #iPhone or if you put #Fuel in your car made from Russian oil or you regularly watch the #PremierLeague or #Formula1 you forfeit the moral high ground to complain about the #Qatar2022 (well done if you fall outside that Venn diagram!)
Other iSheep complain about #icloud storage all the time. They need to buy a better iPhone or iPad with 128gb or more and pay $1 for 50gb of iCloud! Also not be an app hog and wannabe iPhone photographer! Seriously y’all are so annoying!
Some people my age complain about not having the IPhone 14. Which I think is really ridiculous, just you remember that there is people out on the streets that are out there as we speak. They only have a cardboard box to sleep in. Just be grateful for what you have.
"the one thing i hate about tech channels is when they review budget shit and complain about things not being high budget quality.

i'm broke. i'm looking at budget shit for a reason. stop acting like the phone is hot garbage because it doesn't compare to the latest iphone."
"2/4

If you're dissatisfied with the way the country is going, and you elected the same official that runs your state... You can't complain. Keep voting #iPhone, keep voting #Android, it doesn't matter. You're asking things to remain the same. Put a little thought into your decision.

Solution, buy shares of the company, now you just paid yourself. Now apply to twitter. $8 dollars, thank you very much."

I will never stop asking apple for a complain device to the iPhone that is the shape, size and weight of the old iPod nano.
It's disrespectful to complain about subscriptions if you're using an iPhone. It should've been the first tell tale that you can't afford the device. Ungazos'tshela nge Apple Music ne iCloud. Dayisa leyo phone because you clearly can't afford it.
before i storm into the apple shop to complain about this shit iphone 14 pro battery, is anyone else having this problem where the battery just eats itself significantly whilst being unused in my pocket???

If you complain about capitalism from your iPhone, then sorry, you lose.

I just noticed UI lag on my iPhone 14 Pro Max for the first time - was a little shocked! Haha. Was a reminder that even iPhones need to be rebooted at times. While we might complain about bugginess, on the whole, operating systems are much more stable than when was a kid…

Honestly cannot wait for all the people going on about USB-C on iPads and not on iPhone to complain next year when the iPhone goes to USB-C and they complain about lightning and dongles all over again…

I’ve seen people complain about bugs on iOS 16. Mostly on iPhone X and XR. Although, it works very fine on my phone. What iOS are you on? Are you experiencing any bug on your phone?

The fact that people STILL to this day complain about iPhone vs Android is insane to me. It’s a damn phone
This guy bought an iphone 6 from my store yesterday and he came back this morning to complain that he couldn't use the apps he bought the phone for. Google chat, Facebook, Twitter cannot work on IOS 12.5.6 apparently.

As a former Apple tech support, have all of you bitching about iPhone 14 series/iOS 16 “bugs” tried restarting your phone &amp; making sure it’s updated to 16.0.2..? Cuz like, that’s a basic step to fixing almost EVERY issue. Update, restart, then complain. 😂

at least no one gonna complain “letihnya nak edit satu satu” the next time i spilled some iphone edits 😞
It’s crazy how all people want to do is complain about what Apple does with the iPhone. When the X, and XS were out, and had amazing build quality people said “it’s too expensive”. Then they make cheaper models and people say “they never change” and now it’s “why only the pros”…
Also, I’m so blessed that the only thing I have to complain about is my iPhone shipping 1 week late 🙏🙏

😣People are OK to pay 1 Lakh++ for an #iPhone, but will complain if a qualified doctor charges them 300 Rs. consulting fee!
"Don't complain about taxes, rising gas prices and Netflix if you're about to buy an iphone 14.

"Idk why people complain about the apple pencil not being supported on the iPhone and being like ""but samsung has the s pen"" I have met more than 10 people who use samsung phones that have s pens, most of them used it once when they first got the phone and didn't use it again."
Todays a great Friday! I done got a haircut, pre-ordered the new iPhone, got a promotion at work and my Fanduel bet from last night hit. I cannot complain AT ALL
I complain about working so much but working 3 hours spread out over the entire weekend pays for the iPhone I just bought lmao
People always complain about new iPhone prices every year. Then once it launch people still be queuing up at apple store 😂
I’m at the iPhone 11 still and y’all buying a new iphone every year but complain about prices. Use your brain. Prioritize
I don’t think Apple is good at marketing. If they named iPhone 14 and iPhone “Pro 4”, people wouldn’t complain how iPhone 14 Pro is different from just 14 because “it is different model”.
People be creating memes about why Apple developers barely improve the design of Iphone 14. Tapi orang orang tetep aja bakalan kredit tenor 1000 tahun, or god forbid, sewa jasa screenshot ipon di twitter 🤡. Cant complain tho, that's the power of brand image.
everyone's complaining that the iPhone 14 still uses Lightning instead of USB-C, but i guarantee that when Apple switches, people will complain about having to buy new cables
Niggas complain about the new iPhone price like they ain on that payment plan 🤦🏾‍♂️ like the rest of us 🤷🏾‍♂️
People who complain about their situation in life are the same ones that rush to buy the new iPhone as soon as it gets released… and they wonder why they’re stuck in the same position.
People who complain about their situation in life are the same ones that rush to buy the new iPhone as soon as it gets released… and they wonder why they’re stuck in the same position.
If you got on this internet to complain about Dunks, Air Maxes and Forces going up in price for $5 and $10 I don't know if you need to be worried about a NEW iPhone.
People will literally complain and say the new iPhone hasn't changed since the last one and then go buy the new iPhone lol
"Just saw a reporter complain to @tim_cook about his mom using an Android as an issue when iPhones through carriers are usually buy one get one free or your carrier will give you a free lower cost recent iPhone. 

Ruined that reporters whole story 😂"
i dunno why people complain about iphone colours when their cases cover the back anyway
"You and your 2011 Corolla dey complain about people wey still dey use iPhone 6.

🤡🤡"
If you can afford iPhone 14 Pro and still complain about life, something is wrong somewhere.
iPhone 6 is treading. Looking back at my red iPhone 7 + I replaced this year. It was time 2 go. That battery life was so trash but it was a good ride. iPhones r not trash, ppl just love to replace them every year &amp;then complain about it. Honey give a few years. Patience is better
Yall can complain about the iPhone 14 not being different all yall want but I’m still on iPhone X so this upgrade about to go crazy

"You have ordered the latest iPhone, iWatch, iPad….

You have waived your right to complain about cost of living and energy costs."
"Waiting for one of these BIG YouTubers who complained about 60hz on Pixel 6a to complain about it on those new WAY more expensive iPhone's.

Except wait, we know they won't as Apple would remove their exclusive access wouldn't they.

Definitely trust their ads..I mean ""reviews"".."
The world is cruel and my iphone wants me to delete my videos that I complain about life in for 15 minutes that's brutal
Y’all complain about the new iPhone every year &amp; still get it 😒 it’s me I’m y’all
Love seeing people complain about the #AppleEvent saying that Apple hasn’t done anything innovative since the iPhone X 😂

"That time of the year again when all iSheeps complain about insignificant upgrades in the new iPhone while going to extreme lengths to make sure they get their hands on it first.

 #AppleEvent #Apple #iPhone14 #AppleEvent2022"
When people complain that they just got the iPhone 13 it makes me laugh. Acting like apple hasn’t released the new phone at the same time every year since forever.

I wanna complain about the iPhone release… but imma shut up bc I know imma be one of the first ones to have it like every year smh

"#AppleEvent The New Apple Watch (Ultra &amp; 8 Series) are amazing. AirPods Pro 2 and iPhone 14 / 14 Plus just an update. Improvements for the iPhone 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max.

"So everybody dey buy 2m new iPhone?

Be like nobody really dey struggle here sha. Why una de complain about Buhari na ?"
Y’all complain about them iPhone prices every year 😂
A detail passed over in today's Apple iPhone announcements: none of the iPhones announced use USB-C instead of a Lightning connector. The design and manufacturing lead times on these products are multiple years, so it's no big surprise, but I suspect some will complain anyway.
People complain after every #AppleEvent but somehow everyone has a new iPhone afterward 🥱
"People will complain about the price of the iPhone 14 Pro, but the pro model has literally been $999 since the 2017 (iPhone X).

Whilst the cost of cars…"
Let me complain on how iPhone 14 looks like 11 12 and 13 when i cant even afford the iPhone 8 #AppleEvent
Y’all complain about iPhone every year yet everybody got a iPhone stfu mane. 🤣

Never complain - Make it happen…"
"Hamsters.

You know, those fuzzy critters who complain about capitalism while they drink Starbucks and buy the latest iPhone?

Oh. Wait a sec. I meant hipsters, not hamsters."
"If you sip Starbucks daily, surf on the lastest iPhone, wear wireless Airpods, strut in Lulu's while gazing at your smart watch yet complain you're broke,
YOU ARE YOUR OWN BIGGEST ENEMY. 
Not society. 
Not minimum wage.
Not the education system. 
IT'S YOU!"
My mum has just decided to hate on everything apple, so now that she got a new computer from her work and it’s a Mac she decided to message me and my older sister who has mac, iPhone, AirPods, etc. to complain about how horrible it is.
"Google how much it costs to build an iPhone. Then tell me how much you paid for yours.

THEN...remember not to complain to me about how much cars are selling for these days."

My mom hates her iPhone. She keeps on texting me to complain about it

"I would love to meet the marketing team behind the new Android messagings ads I keep getting everywhere.

“What if we publicly complain about how our messenger is bad, and how this wouldn’t be an issue if the user just bought an iPhone?”"
The same people who spent $1000 on an iPhone and $100K on a college degree complain about a $100 course.
So apparently I’m getting my iPhone 13 today, didn’t even want it but I’m not gonna complain
If you don't mind the notch in the iPhone, then you have no right to complain about the crease on the Galaxy Fold.
I used to complain about how I don’t like seeing the iPhone 11 and up because of the cameras but here I am…
Dudes will complain about a QR Code menu then go home and do a 14 team Fantasy Football Auction Draft from their iPhone 3Gs
I'm gonna buy an iPhone just for sake of it and then complain about the nonsensical service Apple provides. Also just for sake of it.
"Me: I never complain about anything. I’m chill.
Kid with a dirty IPhone/IPad: 
Me: Theres ONE THING-"
Chairman said he has iphone 9 so I should come and buy anytime I see him I try to run 😂 now he dey complain 😂😂
I'm not defending the increased price for the PS5, but some of the people who complain about it are also the same people who spend hundreds on a new iPhone.
Someone just came in to complain about their iPhone registering what they were trying to type. It worked when I tried it. They immediately realized it was because of their long nails that they couldn't text.
I understand why y’all complain about data and service now my service and data gas gotten so much worse since i got a iphone 😭

I could probably use an iphone and not complain if it didn't cost all of my organs combined"
IPhone people love adding an android nigga to a groupchat just to complain... smh

All my iPhone does is complain I got storage left 😭 how did I fill up 1TB in 3 months #Howsway
Why would you buy a company and then cut like 50% of the unique things they were doing? Like don't buy a Samsung and complain it's not enough like an iPhone? Save your money and stop screwing with people's lives
Blue Bannisters is such a good album and people complain that its too heavily a product of its time (“lilac heaven , after your iphone 11” , reference zoom calls and stuff) but to me that just makes it a perfect reflection of 2020
"Im at this house party and this auntie won’t keep quiet 
Who cares if you left your iPhone at home 😭 and do you have to complain about everything. Just go home sis"
the fact that my sister is the only iphone user in the fam and complain when none of use have iphone cable if she ever forgets to bring hers 😭

I like how Google is trying to complain about iPhone not working with Android text messages, but they can't even fix their own web site for Messages so that it doesn't forget the connection to your Android phone. #google #android
My guy Don sell his iPhone 13 pro max, him dey complain his face ID dey disturb his eye. No worry my guy I understand 😂
IPhone owners complain about the color of your bubble but it's way more annoying getting notifications for every single reaction
"tfw as phones (in my opinion.)

castiel: google pixel 6 bc that fucker knows everything like he is google

sam: iphone bc he’s a smart lad and we love him to bits always

Rock and roll Friday night, I just watched the export of my current episode of Waterloo Road on my iPhone to see how it held up. Genuinely loving this show. Especially the performances. Great cast. Great director. I really cannot complain.
Annoyed by the change in dexcom non-critical alerts on iPhone that affects playback volume? I called dexcom to complain and request they change it back. If you’re annoyed too, I suggest calling and filing a complaint. Squeaky wheel gets the grease. #dexcom #T1D
Time to complain about capitalism and still get the new iPhone anyway .
Sorry iphone.  Stop persistently telling me to ‘try again’ whenever i complain about being robbed.  I don’t think my former employers committing fraud and robbing me is ok.
Chiiiile YouTube PIP quietly added on my #iphone ?? @Apple it only took 40 years - but this is exciting. Next can you change the dialing functions in the phone app to do the same thing Android does? Promise I won’t complain about anything else 🤐
It’s the time of the year when people complain about iPhone price and compare it with 1 million other things they can buy with that amount, but still go ahead to buy the iPhone. 🤦‍♂️
Nawa oh I still dey complain say I never use this my iPhone 6 finish una don rush lunch iPhone 14 come out sha una no want make I reach this level nii

Anyways, I’m seeing people complain about the iPhone 14, just why?! Hating on things for clout is draining, stop it
for those who don't know about cubes and wonder why I complain so much about zi hao having a Gan, in other words it's as if I had the first android phone ever and zi hao had an iphone 13
If I have to be honest this iPhone 13 is no different from the 11 other than the color and the camera quality 😵‍💫 but issa gift so I’m not going to complain at all
Apple users doesn’t want to use android bcuz it’s not an iPhone then Nothing makes an android that is literally an iPhone and apple users complain that it looks like an iPhone… like tf man what do u want
Have been using Iphone 13 pro max for the last 6 months and I am literally at peace, a complete phone. I have tested and used multiple flagship android phones but was dissatisfied. Cant even complain about iPhones charging time as it makes up with battery life. #iPhone  #Apple
Bitches will buy a pink iPhone on a whim then complain they have no money (it’s me)
My work iPhone has an update. I remember in the past you all complain after iPhone updates. Is that still a thing?
Never understood why y’all buy the lowest storage available on the iPhone then complain about not having any storage at all…….😕
When life treat you bad ‘ u too treat am bad no complain” person wey bring Adam story Na hin go suffer am’ na the Apple wey Adam chop all of them wan die for to buy ‘ Apple iPhone.
I wonder when my IPhone 8 will no longer update like my 2 years older iPad won’t any more? If people are going to complain about shit why don’t they complain about replacing something after 5? Years because a company makes you pay for an upgrade. Now that is global warming.
"Y'all normally complain of tecno phones. I have the iphone XR but  I've been using Tecno Camon 12 frequent since I bought it in 2019 and it's just so okay. The camera and everything. No overheating : seamless charge. How many have that phone? 
Not the pro or Air"
if you complain about getting a 700$ iPhone and saying it’s “old” and “cheap” and it’s not even your own money ur using for the phone go die. Especially if ur getting a AirPods AND the latest Apple Watch. Ur literally rich you whore. You live in a fucking mansion.
Yes, I’m the kind of person to have like 10 iPhone cases, then complain about the need to go case-less do display the phone’s beauty 📲😂
Never fails to surprise me people try to use free WiFi on an iPhone without a VPN and complain it doesn't work it's a iPhone security feature not the WiFi
You dey use iPhone 13 and 11 and you dey complain about sapa😂😂🤔 no be juju be that?
Koi ek iPhone 13 phek k maaru. Mai koi complain kuch nhi karungi 🤭
You’ll complain about never using your money to buy an iPhone because it’s too expensive but whenever you want to take pictures, you’ll ask iphone users to use their phones. If it’s not stupidity i dunno what it is
Just wait for the original release because all your gonna get is bugs and your iPhone will get destroyed very quickly. This is why people complain about the beta because something is wrong
"I need to complain about how absolutely laggy &amp; kinda crappy the new @apple iPhone 13
I miss my 8 more &amp; more.
Every action on this phone is slow &amp; sometimes never completes. Switches apps, and seems buggy.
I miss the dedicated home button / fingerprint scanner."
Frenchies dogging on Americans on Twitter like we didn't invent the internet and iPhone. If you want to complain, please send a postcard.
I find it fascinating how someone will buy an iPhone 13 Pro Max and then complain about having to buy a laptop that costs over $1000. The value perception between the two must be miles apart in their minds.
"People always complain about how bad the iPhone SE and Pixel 6a are, but nobody complains about how awful the Galaxy A71039 or whatever tf it’s called is 🤔

Funny how that goes sometimes."
So.... even iPhone users dey complain about SAPA?🤔😂😂
"Orang bodoh jer join #TURUN

My iPhone old af…it’s an XS Max ok…and listen. I can’t even complain cause I just smashed this shit off the ground out of anger thinking “ain’t no way it’s working after that” and…here we are
wild how ppl complain about the pixel 6a having a 60hz display while having a flagship SoC but they say nothing about the iPhone SE having a 60hz display much less the $700 iPhone 13
"It's strange,people are barking at pixel 6A for having 60Hz screen and 18W charging capacity.. But they didn't complain when iphone 13 was launched at 60Hz screen with 20W charging capacity.  Iphone 13 costs twice as pixel6A. 
#Pixel6a
#iPhone13"
Market power of apple is incredible. A lot of people may complain about small things they don’t like but very few are not going to buy an iPhone because of a headphone Jack or many other small things.
I nanny for the guy that programs/calibrates/works on Apple’s iPhone camera stuff, I need people to give me something to complain to him about to harass him
Been using the same iPhone since the 1st lockdown of 2020 😂. The XS, 256 GB. I really can't complain, the phone has been good to me although I could use that 13 pro max battery 😅
"iPhone cord only 180Cedis 
Residents of Osu are they part of Ghanaians wey we Dey complain about hardship? Eeii🥸"
I just don’t get the mindset of people regarding phones.  Like @ChrisEvans the iPhone SE is a couple of grams different to 6S and has a home button.  Why get something different from what you want and then complain about it.
Ya #iPhone users with phones from the yr ya were born in be pressed to complain about my green bubble 🙄
"Wahala
Na last week old taker dey complain say iphone wahala too much 🤣🤣. 
Today I don see am with new tecno phone with two polo and one new jean"

It’s supposed to reach 35 degrees here today (95 F) and all I can think off is… how do I complain to people about this when I still haven’t figured out where the degrees sign is on my iPhone? Do I really need to google in this heat???
"Today the 5 year old I watch twice a week became angry because he took a pretend call on the iPhone he plays with (that doesn’t work) and got fired by his imaginary boss. He then “called” his brother (who doesn’t exist) to complain about it. 

And you thought you had a bad day."
I was gonna play smash out of boredom but it wouldn't let me connect due to an unstable connect so I was gonna take a screenshot to complain about it but it wouldn't post from my switch or send to my iphone.
And now iCloud has broken again between Safari on my Mac and Safari on my iPhone. I suppose I can’t complain. It was a good couple of months.
"Random though….
I used to have galaxy buds 2 with my iPhone XS and it would always tell me it’s loud and to turn it down…. Since I got AirPods I can listen at 103DB and it not complain with the audio notification"
Upgraded to the iPhone pro 13 from the XR and I can’t complain
I wanna upgrade my iPhone but I like my bill being under $100 and I love having a small phone..but this reverse camera quality is sooo low, even on the 12 mini and even at 60 fps. (I complain about this every few months, just support me)
"I dey wonder how people dey reason sef.

Hunger go wonjo your intestine there."
"Seeing all this complain about how Apple photos is bringing back memories of someone they aren’t with anymore 😂 
Me wey since I start to use iPhone do never enter relationships 😭🫴"
We say our friends clothing brand is too expensive and does not cost that much to make, but we never complain about buying a $1000 IPhone that is not worth that much to make.
iPhone users never complain, even when autocorrect constantly fuck them up 😂😂
I wonder why Ice Universe doesnt complain about iPhone's large bezel or Xiaomi 12S Ultra has bigger bezel than Xiaomi 11 Ultra...
apparently USB-C is trending because people like paying ridiculous amounts of money for iPhone chargers.  Probably the same folks that call universal healthcare [socialist commie BS] and complain about gas prices but vote for people who vote against anti-price gouging.
The same people who spent $1000 on an iPhone and $100K on a college degree complain about a $100 course.
Omo i listen to Orente by Adekunle Gold this morning and was like where did he found the Orente wey no dey complain. Na only latest iphone i know get this babe don jaapa. Talkless of you wey no get house, money and orente no complain..... Haaaa
"All of a sudden people are claiming super premium phones feel hollow. First it was the iPhone 13 and now the Pixel 6 Pro.

This is 100% nonsense. I love a nice feeling phone, and neither of these feel hollow or cheap to use. Just something for people to complain about."
The way y’all complain bout iPhone X I think gotta keep mine in a museum cos may battery is strong and the temperature is cool
"No be to buy iPhone X Come Dey Complain For Sub 😏😩

"I love when people complain about items being ""made in China,"" but then are sending those complaints from their iPhone.  You can't have it both ways!"
"Guys, I’d like to complain about extortion. My current iPhone has 512 GB memory. Yet Apple is telling me that my iCloud storage is full and I MUST start paying them monthly for storing my photos, emails, etc!

Do not complain how you don’t have land to mortgage for money to inject into a business. Your moveables may do wonders. Text your bank and declare your IPhone, car, brick maker and wait for the answer.
how do people complain abt being broke and have the latest iPhone every year
Nothing funnier than hearing Gen. Z complain about the new Gen. A. “They have no idea what it used to be like. I didn’t get my first iPhone until I was in middle school.”
I’d always wanted to work for Apple back in the day. But I know iPhone users. They will complain to death over everything because they paid big money for it.

I don’t have Apple Pay I’ve always been suspicious and honestly I like the blackberry phone and wouldn’t have an iPhone if my children didn’t make a big fuss about it. I can’t complain my phone bill is $50 month prepaid
It’s fun getting in Twitter arguments with people about money. Most are just lazy when they complain about money while on their $1500 iPhone claiming $30 extra for gas is a deal breaking
it’s laughable people complain about 5 dollar gas ⛽️ but don’t blink an eye at a 1000 dollar iPhone 📱 which the administration considers a necessity yet don’t see the headline apple makes more money then God just Exxon lol #Biden #Exxon #iPhone #Bidenflation #BidenGasHike #oil

Seeing frustrated users complain about iOS 16 dropping support for iPhone 7 is making me reflect on hardware/software platform backwards compatibility guarantees. I'm genuinely curious what folks think users and developers should be able to count on
people who hate dream but support sapnap and george remind me of people who complain about capitalism on twitter with an iPhone…🧍
"Will I always complain about the expenses that comes with using an iPhone? Yes
Will I go back to using android cause of it? No😭 
will I stop complaining? No😭😂"
So apple isn’t supporting iOS 16 on the iPhone 7, and people are mad but y’all will then proceed to complain about how constant updates make your phone slow and it doesn’t work right. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND JEEZ
Conservatives get all snobby when people complain about being poor when they have TVs and shit, but then don’t apply that logic to how gas prices are now. Like, sorry Todd, but if you really wanted a full tank, you would have skipped that new iPhone upgrade.
Also funny to watch all the people who just haaaave to have a brand new car, brand new iPhone, brand new this or that, complain about prices for everything. Shut the fuck up and cut back on something in life.

Fr though. The only people I see complain about phones is iPhone users talking about andriod
Y’all have every new pair of jays that come out. All this designer this designer that. iPhone 15 MAX Plus and then complain about not having enough money for gas.

Any nigga with an iphone shouldn't complain about being poor😭😂
Yo why tf does my iPhone even let me turn my volume this loud if it’s going to complain about it every 5 seconds
Some people are funny. You have a budget of $100 and you go buy a $100 phone and complain that an iPhone is better. Why are you expecting flagship performance from a $100 android phone?

Yeah. those folks don't complain about paying for expensive iPhones and monthly charges"

 now she got a new iPhone and still she doesn't pick calls and blames us that i don't call only whenever some work is there. 
Hate such PPL😡😡😡"
I find it ironic that 100% of the people that complain about the iPhone SE design regurgitation are literally not the target market. If apple changed the phone to your liking it’s still not the phone you’d buy.
"Honest question: if you WEREN'T a tech enthusiast, do you think you would complain about the 2022 iPhone SE as much? 

I'm talking the biggest paper pain-points I see people have, like the LCD screen, physical design and old camera optics."
"PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN OF being broke , &amp; yet they're using an iPhone.

🙄🙄🙄🤦😂"
If you’re buying the new iPhone when it comes out don’t complain about the price of gas 🙄🤔😒 #AppleEvent
Most apple users I’ve called all below iPhone 11 complain about phone volume could apple be pressuring people to upgrade to latest tech 🧐
"Love it or hate it the iPhone SE 3rd Gen is here and more powerful than most competitors flagships. 😁
Complain about the design and display as much as you want, the SE will probably outlive your competitor flagships by many years.

I don’t understand people who get the new iPhone every single year, but complain about the price of gasoline. Or the people who go on countless vacations. Like you have money. You’re not struggling
i don’t like when people complain about the colors of apple products. but why, why is apple removing the green color option for the ipad air, when they are focusing on green with the iphone and apple watch? 😫
"Tried to trade in my iPhone 8 for the brand new iPhone SE, they shipped the same device but took away all my money. Where do I complain? 😡

#AppleEvent #iPhoneSE #iPhoneSE3 #iPhoneSE2022 #iPhone8"
The people who complain about the iPhone SE not doing the things they want need to realise that they aren’t the target audience for the device. Apple makes a device for you, it’s the flagship product with the large battery.
"Discord is down so I guess I need to express my Apple cynicism here

Those prices never get old. I got really angry when they were touting that the new iPad’s 2X data throughput increase with its USB C port

#appleevent the way they are talking about the iPhone 8 (SE), these guys could sell you an Infinix and you can't complain
Yeay im on iPhone and i gags segerak things to complain

Imagine buying the latest iPhone 64gb, but actually receiving a 256gb… and then proceeding to complain about it. That’s the sort of scenario and customer I deal with!
"""if u have an iphone u cant complain abt apple policies"" is such a stupid take and yet i still see it here n there. if u shell out that much money (apple's fault, not buyer's fault) for a phone u should be able to get it repaired whenever n wherever (also apple's fault)"
badman if ya guh complain about the 0.99 charge for iCloud monthly storage then you probably shouldn’t own an iPhone, js.
People who complain every year when Apple releases the new iPhone and say 'It's just the same as last year' are fucking GEEKS. Idiot consumer geeks who buy new phones every year when their current one works just fine.
We all just traumatize each other with our business marketing, we also just put up with your disgusting poitjies with 7:1 water to meat ratio and those ugly orange Wambo chickens looking like they went through multiple iPhone filters 🤮😅😂 We don't complain cos it's your hustle

No idea why it is, but at a point it looks really dumb to complain."
I have two minor accessibility things to complain about. 1) Why did the ability to pinch zoom on iPhone change and why is it garbage now? The Magnifier is clunky and I don’t want to use it. Let me pinch zoom in safari.

Little tip:  when you match with someone online, it’s best not to complain about your ex at such length the reader needs to scroll through 7 screens worth of text on a iPhone pro Max.   It’s not a good look.

I'd also like to take this time to complain about AirDrop. I know it has Air in the name, but does it have to be so literal? Why can't I send a file from iPhone to a Mac that is connected via ethernet. They are on the same network! I thought this is what Bonjour was for.
Imagine taking out your iPhone to complain on Twitter that crypto is bad for the environment...

Don’t come on Twitter—of all places—on BHM to complain about how you hurt the Black community w/o apologizing, first &amp; foremost, Nora. You knew this topic’s been discussed many times, and you still have yet to face it—hiding behind iPhone essays, the white way.

And when I complain about it, it’s my fault @AppleSupport It’s my fault that the newest iPhone’s backglass breaks out of nowhere so the only option is to pay you extra money. And when I refuse to do that, you hung up the phone. Is this how you treat your customers?

also i dont complain about my current phone enough here- i got this iphone 6s four years ago, which at the time it wasnt even new anymore. idek when it started fucking up, but nowadays it holds a charge for 40 mins, crashes, glitches, has very mediocre camera quality, and-
You know your life is pretty good if you complain about it on your iPhone.
First time my lil bro didn't complain about me buying music on his iPhone 😭 Juice one of his fav artists!!
My husbands been hearing me complain about my phone and I’m always using his hotspot so he bought me the iPhone 12 with unlimited data. Ladies, if he wanted to he really would ❤️
offline players will endlessly complain about wifi smash then proceed to exclusively play on their iPhone 4's hotspot
Apple/iPhone needs to upgrade to 2022 communication. Need to add way more than “36 emojis” that are the most frequently used. People be using 50+ just to complain about their job alone.
"Most times when I look at people that complainn of not having capital to start a profitable business

They are always with either iPhone or one big gadget like that and still they complain of no capital

Ohk, is that iPhone that will feed you for the rest of your life? 🤔"
you know the same ppl who’re defending pleasing not having a variety of inclusive clothing sizes “because it’s a new brand” probs would’ve been the same ones to complain and say shit if they released phone covers only for iphone 12 and 13
"When iPhone released, age 50+ needed lessons &amp; complained, children figured it out in minutes.

As Web 3 grows, the generation growing up with it will ""get it"" naturally, and the old generation will need lessons &amp; complain.

If you're resisting it now, you're the old generation."
"I they with you wey you complain say your 5s screen too small for you, you wan change. Person ask you later why you they use iPhone 5s, you get mind tell am say you like am, say na Vintage 😩😩😩😩. You no even fear say I never comot there😩.

Omoh wale no be o so, no be so 😩😩"
Every week I complain that Spotify can't curate song recommendations for me and with each week I'm tempted to switch to apple music despite not owning an iPhone
Such a weird thing to complain about, but this @twelvesouth iPhone stand is.. oddly bad. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. C+ would probably not buy again.
I complain a lot about iPhone predictive text, but Samsung is just as bad. This phone keeps trying to add kisses to the end of messages when I’m texting the carpenter who’s fitting my new door!
"My phone was snatched in Delhi. I went to my nearest police station, I said ""I have the location of my phone, because it was an Iphone, on ""Find my"", on next day I filed complaint somehow, still no action taken yet.

The youth of today play mobile phone games and spend money on little things, but don't know the good old days with C64 / NES / SNES etc., which is actually a shame, but complain about a 10 dollar Super Mario on the iPhone, find the logic😆
"Daft thinking Nigerians will see that you use an iPhone, the moment you complain that you’re broke, they suggest that you sell your iPhone and get an Android phone.      

That’s poverty mentality at its peak I must say."
"I'm asking why I should pay 500 Naira because you trimmed the sides of my hair and you're telling me I shouldn't complain because I'm holding an iPhone.

The foolish entitlement and greed in the common folk. Did you contribute money for my iPhone?"
"Lucas: Cat, get the normal sized iPhone. 
Lucas: Cat, the max is too big. 
Lucas: Cat, you complain about the one you have now being too big.

Cat: *proceeds to buy pro Max*
Cat: *might have regrets*
Cat: *maybe should have listened to her boyfriend who knows her very well*

😅"

So Apple has been deactivating Apple ID’s for a while now. Got customers complain left and right. I would suggest you turn off your find my iPhone feature for now! That’s your best option for now. If your Apple ID is disabled you phone becomes iCloud locked and I useable!!!
"So many doors have been opened. 

Yet people complain that the world is MORE unfair:

- You can film an Oscar winning movie on your iPhone
- You can start a company for less than $1000
- You can produce grammy winning music on your laptop

Stop bitching. Start doing."
i will never forgive my irls that went to hslot with me making me (ipjone10) film everything bc they didn’t want too( iphone 11) and then complain abt the quality
People will complain about not having money then go buy a new iPhone for $1000 after having the last one for a year.
"Sold my old Samsung A50 to a colleague after i heard her complain she cannot find an Iphone for less than 200 bucks second hand.
I sold my A50 for €50 and uh, i am rolling today: Sisters gotta pay me back 25 respectively too.
So... Yes! I am swimming in moners."
Always don't understand how my parents complain about money yet both of them refuse to get anything other than the newest premium(the big one w/e it is) iPhone model when their phone leases are up when I tell them they can get a S21 for 30% of the price

"Nobody:
People who arbitrarily draw lines to complain about things:

Sure that's good, but too bad the company does xyz wrong things.

Sent from an iPhone"
Seeing people complain on Facebook that the government is tracking them with vaccines while they carry an iPhone with them everywhere is just incredible.
9 times out of 10 if you hear someone complain how Apple fans are all sheep for buying an iPhone, they have a Samsung phone. Who, by the way, has had the highest global market share of cell phones for like the past decade. So ask yourself, who really is the sheep?
"In the Arab world the obsession to change the iPhone device whenever a new model comes out is unreal! No matter how in good condition the phone is,they must upgrade..unlike Europeans,could still complain that their iPhone 5S battery aint functioning as before!

The foreign correspondence that is tech media reporting has been prone to complain about the high prices of flagship phones. With the best of them running well past the thousand dollar mark. As opposed to their non domestic market whereby iPhone Max 13 cost 2 thousand 400 dollars
So i went to one of the @accessbank branch to complain about my accessmore app that stop working on my phone, and the customer service rep legit told me that their app no longer support iPhone that I should go get android phone before I can use the app🙄.
Not sure who to complain to first…@LGUS or @peacockTV but nothing is able to stream on Peacock on my new LG TV. I know it’s not a systemic issue because I can stream on other TV’s and my iPhone app. HELP! I’m having @theofficetv withdrawals! 😭
Iphone users will complain of low battery😅

I was going to complain about how I can't transfer all my Duo 2FA accounts to a new phone but it turns out they added this feature and iPhone 6 is just too old XD XD XD
I don’t generally complain about iPhone updates because I know I’ll adjust to whatever they throw at me, but years ago they changed their keyboard—specifically the space bar—and I’ve still not recovered.
It’s these android users that only use WhatsApp that complain you have to pay for everything on iPhone bitch stop lying
Girls would get the iPhone 13 max pro and complain their skinny pants pockets can’t hold it.
"Ppl used to complain about angles on iPhone's face id, well that's a phone and u can move/tilt to get it right but do u feel comfortable tilting a 16' screen up and down..? Touch id is lot more appropriate for laptops I'd say
@MKBHD #MacBookPro"

Just had a customer complain that I have bad service because we’re not allowed to reserve an iPhone for them when it comes back in stock.

Disappointed by the special effects in Dune. Some of you will say that if I didn't watch it on an iPhone 13 Pro Max I shouldn't complain but really with that budget it should have blown me away on just a regular iPhone 13 Pro as well.
Smashed my phone screen last night. Haven't done that in five years. Had the same phone (an iPhone SE, the original kind) ever since. Guess I can't complain too loudly.

"People complained that apple didn’t include 6E iPhone 13.

People complained when apple didn’t include 11ax in the Xs
