My teacher has still the @u2 songs of innocence for free but he don‚Äôt complain at all. And even he is not a really big U2 fan. I like this kind of people. I ask him why you don‚Äôt delete it. He said I cannot delete it. When you bought a new IPhone the album is there. üòÇ
"Imagine if the requirements to complain about Rihanna's performance were to have a matching bank account and talent, the internet would be a quiet place today.

The same people slating people for playing Hogwarts Legacy will wear Coco Chanel perfume (nazi) watch Miramax movies (sex offender Weinstein) and complain on Twitter with their iPhone (child labour and human rights issues). Get your heads out of your asses. Idiots. #HogwartLegacy
I'm back on Twitter to complain about how shocked I am that iPhone has not figured out FaceTime Voicemails. I refuse to update my phone again until this is sorted.

I don't know why do people even complain about iPhones not having AOD (except for 14 Pro series). Not having an AOD is actually a feature because Apple doesn't want iPhone users to get distracted every time they look at their phone while doing some work, as the screen is on.

A lot of customers complain that their devices turning extremely hot. They also affirm that feel like their phones are swelling and they open by themselves. This problem was already explained, but iPhones tend to present this issue more than other phones."
The main advantage of Android app development always taking a back seat to Apple app development is watching all you iPhone users complain about Twitter crop this and that and I'm just here with no crop update still.

iPhone users complain about storage but they have not considered the fact that it's because they take too many photos in their perfect camera. if they had a shitty android camera they wouldn't be taking photos and complaining about having no storage

It's so funny watching iPhone consumers complain about the device that they chose to spend $1,000+ and they don't know how anything works. They don't even know how to use iCloud properly.

There are people who complain about @elonmusk  complaining about Apple on an iPhone, but at the same time they complain about @Twitter on Twitter...
Like there's a 0% chance that we won't be able to use the twitter app on iPhone but Elon told us cuz they probably got some guidelines he doesn't like and to bypass em he just makes us all complain bout the shit potentially not being on there so now apple sees it and yields
It's so funny how @elonmusk is hating on everyone who rants about him, especially those who use Twitter to complain to him, and yet here he is now bitching about Apple, as he tweets on his iPhone.
"A few weeks ago Elon Musk tweeted why the left were using Twitter to complain about Twitter 

Well, today he has been using his iPhone to complain about Twitter with Apple ü§≠"
"Musk is using an iPhone to complain about Apple on twitter. 

He was making jokes of people the other complaining about twitter on twitter.üòÄ

It's kind of funny watching people complain about Apple while tweeting from their #iPhone.

We complain about Twitter on Twitter. Elon complained about Apple - on Twitter - on an iPhone. The difference is: He can set up a meeting with Apple to understand why Apple would do this if he was serious. He knows. He doesn't care. He is just making noise. Distraction.
"You can't complain about Twitter if you use Twitter
You can't complain about Apple if you use an iPhone
You can't complain about gas prices if you drive a gas car
You can't complain about the president if you live in the country

Musk using an iPhone to complain about Apple just emphasizes the point of how much of a monopoly they seem to have.
I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT APPLE WHILE TWEETING WITH iPHONE
Hey Elon, we should edit Twits! My fingers are big. No matter how oversized my iPhone is when I type, my fingers go here and there. Make errors unintentionally. My iPhone doesn‚Äôt complain, but it bothers me.
You have to be stupid to complain about the battery on the iPhone 14 pros if you‚Äôre using always on display. Do people think it‚Äôs not gonna take the battery down or something? It‚Äôs still using the screen and showing notifications so of course it‚Äôs gonna die faster than the 13 pro
